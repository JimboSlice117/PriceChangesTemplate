# PriceChangesTemplate

This project is a Google Apps Script-based price management tool. Unit tests for
some utility functions are provided using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running Tests

1. Install dependencies (only needed once):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Execute the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The tests cover SKU normalization and B-stock detection logic.
